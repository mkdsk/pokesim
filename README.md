---
PokeSim is a new version of the original Pokemon Simulator I wrote in Python over 2 years ago, now written in Java. As of now it's just a small project that I write in my free time, I may expand it further in the summers. I have also planned to implement graphics.

# Features
---
- Simulation of Pokemon style turn based battles
- HP, Abilities, Held Items, Attacks, Mega Forms, Weather Conditions
- Custom Pokemon creation ingame
- Multiplayer battles
- AI battles
- EVs and IVs
- Stats and Natures
- Accurate damage calculation
- Attack evasion
- Saving and viewing of profiles, stat tracking

# Installation
---
This project doesn't require any dependencies, you can move the /src/ folder into an IDE and run the file "/src/game/Game.java".

# Website
---
I am also planning to add a nice looking website. If you are interested (I honestly doubt anyone else will see this repo though) you can contact me at khackdev@gmail.com.
